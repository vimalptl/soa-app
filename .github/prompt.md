An interactive app that displays the SEO (meta) tag for any website in an interactive visual way to check that they'r e properly implemented.  The app should fetch html for the site, then provide feedback on SEO tags in accordance with the best practices for SEO optimization.  The app should give google and social media preview.

What is the app?  
How do i use the app?   
What are the patterns behind the app? How do I make the app most useful for the target audience.
